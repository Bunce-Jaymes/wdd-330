    <h3>Chapter 9 - The Window Object - Notes:</h3>

    <div id='square'></div>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
            methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
        <li>The Navigator object contains information about the browser
            being used.</li>
        <li>Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and
            operating system being used.</li>
        <li>The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has
            already loaded, it will completely replace the current document</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were
            invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.
            This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to
            another.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Chapter 14 - HTML5 APIs - Notes:</h3>

    <div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'>

    </div>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
            attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are
            not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
        <li>Data values must: Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or
            underscores and can include an optional string value.</li>
        <li>The restriction of only using a string value can be overcome by encoding any
            JavaScript object or value as a JSON string, then performing type-conversion later,
            as required.</li>
        <li>Worker() constructor function to create a new worker: "const worker = new Worker('task.js');"</li>
        <li> HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It
            also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips</li>
        <li>A shim or a polyfill
            comes in handy. These are libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as
            usual. They then fill in the necessary code that’s not provided natively by the
            user’s browser.</li>
        <li> The main difference
            between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing
            functionality to a browser, although the implementation method may differ
            slightly from the standard API. A polyfill is a shim that achieves the same
            functionality, while also using the API commands that would be used if the
            feature was supported natively.</li>
