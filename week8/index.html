    <p>See below/console for examples and tests from this week's reading.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 8 Notes:</h3>

    <h4>Put your <span>dukes</span> up, sire</h4>
    <p id="skewed">Skewed text</p>
    <p id="bike">Animated man, hover on me!:</p>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>The skew (x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
        <li>To change the origin of the transform use the transform-origin property.</li>
        <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the
            duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.</li>
        <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in
            even more granular detail.</li>
        <li> A negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire
            transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start partway through the
            animation. </li>
        <li>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.</li>
        <li>CSS animations allow you to
            control each step of an animation via keyframes</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>Canvas uses a coordinate system in the canvas elements.</li>
        <li>You can use the same process on a canvas for changing color of img for videos as well.</li>
        <li>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, as we saw when we turned our video from
            color to black and white. One downside of canvas is that it operates in what’s known
            as immediate mode. This means that if you ever want to add more to the canvas,
            you’re unable to simply add to what’s already there</li>
        <li>By contrast, what you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is
            retained mode, meaning that the structure of the image is preserved in the XML
            document that describes it. S</li>
