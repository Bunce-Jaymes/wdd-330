    <h2>Notes for Week 7:</h2>

    <p>See console for examples and tests from this week's reading.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 11 Notes:</h3>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an
            object that is provided as the first argument. If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as
            arguments after the first argument.</li>
        <li>The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the
            function are provided as an array,</li>
        <li>You can add your own properties to functions in the same
            way that you can add properties to any object.</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a function that is ran as soon as it is created.</li>
        <li>If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable will maintain the
            original function definition and not be rewritten.</li>
        <li>If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when
            the function redefines itself</li>
        <li> These functions are
            preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it
            was synchronous.</li>
        <li>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,
            maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.
        </li>
        <li>Calling a generator function doesn’t actually run any of the code in the function.
            It returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that
            implements a next() method that returns a value every time the next() method
            is called.</li>
        <li>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument,
            or return another function as a result, or both.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter 13 Notes:</h3>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a
            server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory
            argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. </li>
        <li>The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s
            returned when the promise is fulfilled. </li>
        <li>The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new
            promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.
        </li>
        <li>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to
            completion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can
            be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a
            spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>The json()
method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a
promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
