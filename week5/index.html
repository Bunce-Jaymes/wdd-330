    <h2>Notes for Week 5:</h2>

    <p>As this chapter focused on testing and I am pretty familiar with testing I opted to take notes more to help me remember the import parts. I also began working on the ToDo List challenge.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 10 Notes:</h3>

    <ul class="week2List">
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
            program to deal with the error</li>
        <li>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a
            JavaScript file: 'use strict';</li>
        <li>Linting tools are designed to
            highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
            if certain style conventions are not followed.</li>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception
            occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function</li>
        <li>Throwing an exception is just like Java.</li>
        <li>Writing tests will help me catch more errors early and less time debugging later.</li>
        <li>Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual
            code</li>
    </ul>
